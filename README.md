# SoukiAdventure
SoukiAdventure is an old school RPG game in orthogonal view.

Many time has been spent on rendering map level, collisions management and generic mechanisms tu add easily new interactions in game.
It uses libgdx sdk but it is written more specificly for android (UI, controls, etc) and Tiled file format for level design.
JSON files are massively used to describe level interactions.

To be continued...
